Analyze this news article and extract geographic locations with their context.

For each location found, provide:
1. The exact text as mentioned in the article
2. A standardized name for geocoding (resolve nicknames/abbreviations)
3. Context clues from the surrounding text (1-2 sentences)
4. Confidence level (high/medium/low)
5. Location type (city/state/country/landmark/region/nickname/generic)
6. Disambiguation hints (other location clues from article)
7. Geographic scale level (1=continent, 2=country, 3=state, 4=region, 5=city, 6=neighborhood, 7=landmark)

Special handling:
- Colloquial names: "Big Apple" → "New York City"
- Abbreviations: "LA" → "Los Angeles" (check context for state/country clues)
- Generic terms: "downtown" → include city context if available
- Ambiguous names: "Paris" → look for country/state context clues
- Context-dependent: "the border" → specify which border if context allows
